## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
```typescript
// Core Technologies
- React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router v7 for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations

// State Management
- React Context for global state
- Custom hooks for data fetching
- Local storage for persistence

// UI Components
- Radix UI primitives

```

### Backend Infrastructure
```sql
-- Supabase Services
- PostgreSQL database with RLS
- Real-time subscriptions
- File storage (avatars, chat_media)
- Edge functions for custom logic
- Row Level Security policies

-- Database Tables (30+ tables)
- profiles, rooms, messages
- conversations, room_members
- friends, notifications
- user_sessions, audit_logs
- message_reactions, attachments
```

### Security Implementation
- **Row Level Security** on all tables
- **User-based data isolation**
- **Secure database functions** with proper search_path

## 🚀 How Features Work

### 💭 Chat System Flow
1. **Create conversation** → Insert into `conversations` table
2. **Add members** → Insert into `conversation_members`
3. **Send message** → Insert into `messages` with real-time broadcast
4. **Receive message** → Supabase real-time subscription updates UI
5. **React to message** → Insert into `message_reactions`
6. **Track read status** → Update `message_reads` table

### 🏠 Room Management Flow  
1. **Create room** → Call `create_room_and_join()` RPC function
2. **Generate join code** → Auto-generated 6-character code
3. **Join room** → Call `join_room_safe()` with capacity checks
4. **Member permissions** → Role-based access (admin/member)
5. **Room discovery** → Public rooms listed with search/filters

### 👤 Profile System Flow
1. **User signup** → Auto-create profile via database trigger
2. **Profile updates** → Direct table updates with validation
3. **XP calculation** → Automatic via activity triggers
4. **Level progression** → Calculated based on XP thresholds
5. **Public access** → Via `/@username` routes

### 🔔 Notification Flow
1. **Event occurs** → Trigger creates notification record
2. **Real-time delivery** → Supabase broadcasts to subscribers
3. **UI updates** → Notification bell shows count
4. **User interaction** → Mark as read, dismiss, or act
