1. Install Specify
Initialize your project depending on the coding agent you're using:

uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>

2. Create the spec
Use the /specify command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the what and why, not the tech stack.

uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify 

/specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.

3. Create a technical implementation plan
Use the /plan command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git plan

/plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.


4. Break down and implement
Use /tasks to create an actionable task list, then ask your agent to implement the feature.

uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git tasks
